# Restaurants-Explorer

This is Restaurants Explorer app that I`ve made for Teamvoy company as a testtask

App.js - Navigation container between screens
Screens/HomeScreen - HomeScreen which every user will see
Screens/DetailsScreen - Screen with detailed information about article that user have chosen from the list 

Src/components - I`ve obviously created different components for different screens. In this directory most components
made for HomeScreen, except FooterForDetails, HeaderForDetail.

I was using NewsApi for this task
