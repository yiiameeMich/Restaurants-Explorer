# Restaurants-Explorer

This is Restaurants Explorer app. Its aim is to show to user every restaurant and food related article. You can sort articles, search for exact articles and view detailed information such as name of article, description, article, when it was created, its author and open full article in browser. 

App.js - Navigation container between screens
Screens/HomeScreen - HomeScreen which every user will see
Screens/DetailsScreen - Screen with detailed information about article that user have chosen from the list 

Src/components - I`ve obviously created different components for different screens. In this directory most components
made for HomeScreen, except FooterForDetails, HeaderForDetail.

I was using NewsApi for this app
